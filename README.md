# Enhance Scanning

This is a project that aims to enhance the scanning experience for 3D scanning with iPhone LiDAR. We implemented the SCNTechnique with metal to mask the unscanned area, and use transparent material to make the scanned object more realistic. 

For more about SCNTechnique, please refer to [Apple's document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scntechnique).

<!-- For more implementation details, please refer to my blog article [Enhancing 3D Scanning with iPhone LiDAR](https://www.graphopti.com/blog/enhancing-3d-scanning-with-iphone-liDAR).
